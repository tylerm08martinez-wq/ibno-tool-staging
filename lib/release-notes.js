// THE RELEASE NOTES LIST (#1020, spec #1019).
//
// Since 2026-09-12 (#1017) the IBNO Coder ships to a staging mirror from `main`
// and to production only when the `release` branch is moved forward. That made
// "what is on staging but not production" a fact knowable only by reading git,
// which is not a thing Tyler can do from the cage PC at 03:00.
//
// `release-notes.json` at the repo root is the one source of truth: one entry
// per merged PR that changed a shipped tool. This module is the only place its
// shape is stated, so the guard test, the staging panel (#1021) and the release
// queue script (#1022) all agree about what an entry is.
//
// THE ENTRY SHAPE, and every field is load-bearing:
//
//   { "id": "pr-1004", "pr": 1004, "issue": 998, "tool": "ibno-coder",
//     "title": "Station tab pulls station packages out of Needs Review",
//     "summary": "…one or two PLAIN sentences, written for the cage PC…",
//     "watchFor": ["…0-4 one-line things to look out for while testing…"],
//     "howToSee": ["Load the full-detail export", "Open Set aside", "…"],
//     "mergedAt": "2026-09-11", "commit": "bc1f21c", "shippedAt": null,
//     "order": 1 }
//
// `order` IS WRITTEN BY `scripts/release-queue.js`, NEVER BY HAND — the entry's
// rank in git first-parent order, `null` for one git cannot place. It exists so
// the queue issue and the staging drawer cannot list the same queue in two
// different orders; see the comparator below.
//
// `mergedAt` IS THE UTC DATE OF THE SQUASH COMMIT (#1023 review, LOW). Read it
// with `git log -1 --date=iso-strict` (which prints the commit's own recorded
// offset, so it does not depend on where the reader is) and normalise to UTC —
// `new Date(iso).toISOString().slice(0, 10)`, or `git log --date=iso-strict` +
// `TZ=UTC0`. The backfill originally used Phoenix local dates, which put three
// entries (pr-1009, pr-1011, pr-1013 — all merged after 17:00 local) on the
// wrong day; `tests/release-notes-guard.test.js` now pins every entry against
// its commit's UTC date. Same clock as `build-info.json`'s `builtAt`, so
// #1022's `--stamp` re-deriving these dates cannot shuffle them.
//
// `shippedAt` is null until the entry's commit reaches `release` AND production
// has been deployed; the promote step stamps it. NOTHING ELSE MAY BE READ AS
// "shipped": a commit can be on `release` for hours before the deploy runs, and
// the whole point of this file is that merging is not shipping.
//
// THE REGISTER IS THE CAGE PC, NOT THE REVIEWER (#1028). `summary`, `watchFor`
// and `howToSee` are read at 03:00 by a supervisor deciding whether a change is
// safe to put in front of the admins: plain words, no code identifiers, no repo
// paths, one or two sentences. The dense engineering detail is NOT lost — it is
// in the PR body every card links to, which is where a reviewer reads it.
//
// #1019 said decisions Tyler should know go in `summary` rather than a new
// field, and the reason still holds — a field nobody renders is a field nobody
// writes. `watchFor` is not that field: it is ALWAYS rendered when it has
// items, and it exists because cramming the judgement calls into `summary`
// measured 5,268px of solid prose across 11 cards, which is the same as not
// showing them at all. One prose field plus a short always-shown list beats
// either alone.
//
// `parse` VALIDATES AND THROWS. A release-notes file that is silently half-read
// is worse than one that is missing: the panel would show four items of seven
// and there is no visible difference between "three are unlisted" and "three
// were not built". Every rejection names the entry index and the field.
//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.ReleaseNotes
// - Node:    require('./lib/release-notes')

  // issue (#1022/#1024) and this panel (#1021) are read side by side, so they
  // must not be able to disagree. Git first-parent order is the real shipping
  // order and `mergedAt` is DAY-granular, which #1024's review measured

  // `scripts/release-queue.js` writes its rank into each entry as an integer
  // `order` on every resolve/generate/stamp, and this comparator reads it.
  // CHANGING EITHER SIDE ALONE SPLITS THE TWO SURFACES — the pin that catches
  // it is in tests/release-queue.test.js, asserting the issue's list order and
  // this module's `pending` order are the same sequence.
  //
  // No `order` (git could not place the commit, or nothing has run the script
  // since the entry was written) falls back to `mergedAt` then `pr`, and sorts
  // AFTER every ranked entry: an entry git cannot place is not in the prefix a
