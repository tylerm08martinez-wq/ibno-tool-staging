// THE DAY EXPORT — one file a day, from the Admin's copy into Tyler's
// (issue #794, PRD #790, ADR-0023 item 4).
//
// Under the 999 Desk the IBNO Coder has two users for the first time, on two
// machines, with no shared state and no credential anywhere (ADR-0023 rejects
// both). The Admin's device therefore holds the ONLY record of most of the
// day's work. This module is the whole of the file that carries it across:
// three pure functions over plain objects, no DOM, no clock, no network.
//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.DayExport
// - Node:    require('./lib/day-export')
//
// ─── SCOPE: THE WHOLE DAY (#795), AND THE VERSION THAT SAYS SO ──────────────
//
// #794 shipped VERSION 1, carrying work areas alone. #795 widens the envelope
// to the rest of the day: PARK decisions, the BARCODED and SCANNED lifecycle
// states (ADR-0022), and the REPORT ROWS the exporting device saw. That is
// VERSION 2.
//
// ADDING A STORE TO THE ENVELOPE BUMPS THE VERSION. It is not enough to start
// emitting a new key: a version-1 parser tolerating an unknown key would import
// half a file and say nothing, which is precisely the silent partial import
// story 35 refuses. New store -> new VERSION -> old builds refuse the file out
// loud, which is the whole point of the field.
//
// ─── VERSION 3: A NEW PROVENANCE INSIDE AN OLD STORE (#913, #918) ───────────
//
// #913 adds `remote: true` to entries in the AREAS store — the other desk's
// answer, arriving over the 999 Desk loop. No new store, no new key at the
// envelope's top level, so the rule above does not literally reach it. THE
// VERSION IS BUMPED ANYWAY, because the reason behind the rule reaches it
// exactly (#918 round-three finding 3):
//
//   A v2 build reading a v3 file runs ActualArea.restore, which drops flags it
//   does not know. The entry loses `remote` and arrives at the import boundary
//   carrying an area and NO provenance at all — which is the one shape
//   adoptLegacyTyped is defined to adopt as `typed: true`. The other desk's
//   answer would silently become hand-typed work on the receiving device, and
//   `typed` is on areaProvenanceOf's allowlist, so it would then earn the
//   barcode card's 30px line: a command a package handler walks a package by,
//   for an area nobody on either device confirmed. That is precisely the
//   laundering #913 spends restore() preventing, arriving one hop out through
//   a file instead of through the store.
//
// So: a store is not the only thing whose addition an old build cannot safely
// half-read. A PROVENANCE AN OLD BUILD WILL SILENTLY RE-LABEL COUNTS TOO.
//
// The cost is stated rather than hidden: every Day Export this build writes is
// now refused by a not-yet-updated device, INCLUDING one that carries no remote
// area at all. A conditional version — v2 unless a remote entry is present —
// was considered and rejected: it makes `build`'s output version depend on the
// day's data, so the compatibility a person can rely on would change from one
// export to the next, and the failure it protects against is a records-tier
// mislabel. Deploy is one command to a handful of devices (scripts/README.md).
//
// ─── HOW VERSIONS 1, 2 AND 3 GET ALONG ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The compatibility is deliberately ONE-WAY, and each direction is a different
// promise:
//
//   A v1 FILE STILL IMPORTS INTO THIS BUILD. The Admin may send one from a
//     device that has not been updated yet, and the areas in it are real work.
//     `parse` accepts it and normalises the four missing stores to EMPTY, so
//     `merge` treats it as "this file has nothing to say about park, filing,
//     ticks or rows" rather than as "this file says they are empty". The
//     distinction is not academic: merge never removes from any store, so an
//     empty store can only ever be a no-op. A v1 file is exactly a v2 file
//     whose other four stores happen to be empty.
//
//   A v2 FILE STILL IMPORTS INTO THIS BUILD, on the same terms. It says nothing
//     about `remote`, and an area with no provenance from a v2 file is exactly
//     what it has always been — legacy hand-typed work, adopted as `typed` at
//     the import boundary by dayExportWithAdoptedAreas. That adoption is
//     CORRECT for a v2 file (a v2 build had no other kind of area to write) and
//     WRONG for a v3 one, which is the whole reason the number moved.
//
//   A NEWER FILE IS REFUSED BY AN OLDER BUILD, LOUDLY. That refusal already
//     exists and needed no change at either step: `parse` refuses any version
//     not in its own SUPPORTED_VERSIONS and names the ones it understands, so a
//     `"version": 3` file trips a v1 or v2 build and the person is told to
//     update this copy of the tool rather than half-importing. Do NOT
//     "helpfully" make a future parser tolerate unknown keys — the whole
//     mechanism is that an old build cannot half-read a new file.
//
// SUPPORTED_VERSIONS is therefore a LIST and not a single number, and the
// refusal message names all of it.
//
// ─── EACH STORE MERGES ON ITS OWN TERMS (ADR-0022, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING) ──
//
// The four stores are NOT unified behind one serialization interface, and the
// inconsistency between them is the point rather than a mess to tidy. ADR-0022:
// "the states are stored independently, and no store may be inferred from
// another. A row can be answered without being barcoded, and barcoded without
// being scanned." Collapsing them into one generic map-merge is the #740 class
// — a predicate quietly starting to answer a question nobody asked it.
//
//   areas ... the merge above. Fills a blank, agrees, or DISAGREES and is
//     reported (#796) rather than resolved. Sort-day filtered, see below.
//   parked .. STRICTLY ADDITIVE, AND NEVER SUBTRACTIVE. An import may ADD a
//     park and may NEVER remove one. A file must not be able to undo a
//     judgment call: Park is cleared by hand, and #730 froze it against every
//     automatic clear. NOT sort-day filtered, and that is the one place this
//     module deliberately differs from the areas rule — a park SURVIVES the day
//     roll by design (#730/#753) and a carried park is SHOWN as carried, so
//     filtering one out by date would delete deferred FTrack work that has no
//     other record anywhere. A park is also not a routing decision: it writes
//     no record, no code and no area, so an off-day park cannot walk a package
//     to a belt the way #621's off-day AREA can.
//   filed ... the BARCODED state (lib/ibno-filed.js). Additive union, and
//     SORT-DAY GATED on the incoming store's own stamp. Filing resets on a new
//     sort day (#734 AC7) precisely because "yesterday's assignment is not
//     evidence about today's package" (ADR-0022 invariant 6), and a filed row
//     LEAVES THE WORKING LIST — so importing a stale filing would hide a
//     package that still needs work. Fail closed: an undated filed store cannot
//     prove it belongs to today and is skipped whole.
//   done .... the SCANNED state (lib/barcode-done.js). Additive union, gated
//     exactly as `filed` is and for the same reason, and merged SEPARATELY from
//     it. Nothing here reads one to decide the other in either direction —
//     ADR-0022 invariant 2, barcoded never implies scanned.
// HOW LONG AN IMPORTED PARK OR FILING ACTUALLY LIVES, WHICH IS NOT LONG FOR
// THE POPULATION THIS TICKET IS ABOUT. Every report load prunes both stores to
// the labels the fresh report still carries — IbnoParked.pruneToReport /
// prunePostSortToReport and IbnoFiled.pruneToReport — and a `post-sort` park the
// fresh slice does not carry is explicitly DROPPED. So for a package the report
// has already pruned away, which is most of what the Admin resolved early, an
// imported park has no row to draw and is deleted at Tyler's next drop, and an
// imported filing goes the same way. Only the ARCHIVE ROWS genuinely survive
// for that half.
//
// THAT IS CORRECT AND MUST NOT BE "FIXED" HERE. It is lib/ibno-parked.js's
// standing rule applied to an imported park exactly as it applies to a local
// one: PARK NEVER KEEPS A PACKAGE ALIVE, and a park whose package the fresh
// report no longer carries is moot because someone on the dock got it to the
// right area. Exempting imported parks from the prune would make a file able to
// resurrect deferred work the report says is done — the mirror image of the
// never-unpark rule, and worse, because it would be automatic. The practical
// consequence to know: the park/filed/done halves of the envelope pay off on
// the OVERLAP, where both devices still hold the package; the pruned-away half
// is served by the seen-rows and the archive, which is what they are for.
//
//   rows .... the report rows the exporting device saw. Carried UNCONDITIONALLY
//     and merged into nothing: `merge` hands them back and the page puts them
//     in the 30-day archive, where lib/ibno-archive.js's `keyOf` (tracking +
//     inbound date + scan time) collapses the ones both devices saw BY
//     CONSTRUCTION. They go to the archive unconditionally and to the WORKING
//     LIST NEVER — a package the Admin already finished must not reappear as
//     work on Tyler's screen while its record still lands.
//
// ─── WHY THE SEEN-ROWS ARE COLUMNAR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Measured on the real 2026-08-12 Post Sort export (289 rows, 35 columns):
//
//   one keyed object per row, pretty-printed .... 323.0 KB
//   one keyed object per row, compact ........... 262.0 KB
//   { columns, values }, one line per row ....... 112.4 KB
//
// The Admin's device accumulates every load of a self-pruning report across a
// whole shift, and the 07:54 pull alone is 2,467 rows — so the per-row constant
// is what decides whether this stays emailable. 0.39 KB/row keeps a full day
// under a megabyte; 1.1 KB/row does not. The columnar form is also still
// READABLE BY A PERSON (story 31): a header line naming the columns, then one
// line per row, which is a CSV wearing JSON's clothes.
//
// Columns are NOT trimmed to the ones that carry a value anywhere. It would
// save 2% (109.8 KB of the 112.4) and it would make an imported record a
// SUBSET of the local one with the same archive key — and since the import
// writes second, the fuller local record would be replaced by the thinner
// imported one. A 2% saving is not worth a lossy write into the archive.
//
// ─── WHY REFUSAL IS THE INTERESTING PART ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The worst outcome here is not a merge that gets a package slightly wrong. It
// is a MIS-DROP DESTROYING A GOOD LOADED REPORT: Tyler drops files into this
// tool all day, and the day's coded report is on the other side of the
// operation. So `parse` follows the #445 loud-refusal precedent that
// lib/post-sort-scans.js sets, and ADR-0021's parse-before-reset ordering — it
// throws a TYPED error and the page has changed nothing by the time it does.
//
// FOUR TYPED ERRORS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS A FALL-THROUGH:
//
//   DayExportNotJsonError ......... the file is not JSON at all. This is the
//     CLEAN "not a Day Export" signal, and the ONLY one the page hands on to
//     the existing spreadsheet path. A CSV and an .xlsx both land here.
//   DayExportMalformedError ....... it opens like JSON but does not parse
//     (truncated, half-copied, corrupted in transit), or it is a genuine
//     version-1 envelope whose payload is the wrong shape. TERMINAL: a
//     truncated export must never be handed to the CSV reader, because a
//     spreadsheet parser fed half a JSON file produces rows rather than an
//     error, and rows are how a good report gets replaced by garbage.
//   DayExportForeignJsonError ..... valid JSON, but not this tool's file.
//     TERMINAL for the same reason: a JSON file is definitively not a
//     spreadsheet, so falling through could only ever mis-load it.
//   DayExportUnknownVersionError .. an envelope from a build this one does not
//     understand. TERMINAL, per story 35: fail clearly rather than half-import.
//
// The sniff that separates the first from the rest is deliberately crude and
// deliberately cheap: the first non-whitespace character after any byte-order
// mark. A CSV never starts with `{`, and an .xlsx is a ZIP whose first two
// bytes are `PK`. Anything that DOES start with `{` is claiming to be JSON, and
// this module owns the consequences of that claim rather than passing them on.
//
// ─── THE MERGE, AND THE ONE THING IT DELIBERATELY WILL NOT DO ───────────────
//
// The merge key is the tracking number, which is already how lib/actual-area.js
// stores answers, so a report re-drop and an import cannot collide and there is
// no order the user can get wrong.
//
// `merge` is IDEMPOTENT. Merging the same envelope twice is identical to
// merging it once, so Tyler never has to remember whether he already did it.
// It achieves that WITHOUT a clock: an incoming entry either fills a blank,
// agrees with what is already held, or disagrees with it, and only the first of
// those three writes anything.
//
// A DISAGREEMENT KEEPS THE LOCAL VALUE AND IS REPORTED, NEVER RESOLVED.
// Latest-write-wins is explicitly rejected by PRD #790: it would settle a real
// disagreement about a physical package by clock order, and that is this repo's
// wrong-belt error class. Surfacing the disagreement to Tyler is #796; this
// module's job is to make sure #796 has something to surface, and to leave a
// seam it can replace rather than a resolution it has to undo.
//
// ─── WHY MERGE FILTERS BY SORT DAY ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// #621 is the reason. An area carried across sort days does not merely display
// stale — it reads as FINISHED in three places at once (the Work-mode cursor
// skips the row, the progress bar counts it, and a typed value reads as
// scanned), so a package can be walked to a belt that was right yesterday. A
// late-arriving email must not be able to do that, so an incoming entry whose
// stamp is not the local device's sort day is SKIPPED and counted, never
// imported. An entry with no stamp cannot prove it belongs to today and is
// skipped too — the same fail-closed choice ActualArea.reflow's rule 2 makes,
// for the same reason.
//
// When the local device has no sort day at all (nothing loaded yet), there is
// nothing to judge against and the filter does not apply. That is safe because
// the next report load rolls any off-day area into a dated note before it can
// be worked (SortDay.rollToSortDay, #695), which is the existing net this case
// falls into rather than a new hole.
//
// ─── `by` UNDER reflow: THE DECISION ADR-0022 HANDED FORWARD ────────────────
//
// ADR-0022 ("`by` is attribution, and it is not in that table") names this as
// #794's to make deliberately. Once this merge lands, ActualArea.reflow's
// source can be an IMPORTED entry, so the blank it fills would be stamped with
// someone who was never at that machine.
//
// DECIDED: it propagates, unchanged. `by` answers "who decided this stop's
// belt", not "who was sitting at this keyboard". The Admin's FRO lookup is what
// puts every package at that address on that belt, whichever machine renders
// the row, so the name is true of the sibling in the only sense the field is
// used for — coaching a repeated wrong-belt pattern back to the person whose
// judgement produced it. The alternative writes a BLANK, which is worse twice
// over: it is indistinguishable from genuine pre-#793 unattributed work, and it
// would make the Admin's own archive and Tyler's disagree about the same row,
// which is the opposite of story 19. reflow therefore needs no change, and this
// paragraph exists so that stays a decision rather than an inheritance.

// ─── VERSION 4: THE STATION PANE CROSSES THE DESK (#1002, spec #996) ────────
//
// Two genuinely new stores join the envelope, so the rule at the top of this
// file applies in its plainest form — NEW STORE -> NEW VERSION:
//
//   station ..... lib/station-store.js's carried row projection. What came in
//                 for the office, what is still out, how long it has sat.
//   overrides ... lib/tracking-overrides.js. "Send to Station", "Not ours" and
//                 "Undo" — a PERSON'S ANSWER about a package, the one thing in
//                 this tool that outranks a rule.
//
// STATION ROWS MERGE ON THE PARK TERM, NOT THE AREAS TERM. Additive, never
// subtractive, and NOT SORT-DAY GATED — an open station package deliberately
// survives the day roll (lib/station-store.js: the roll prunes delivered and
// keeps open), so filtering an incoming row by its stamp would delete exactly
// the carried work the pane exists to make visible. The delivered half is the
// only field a merge ever fills, and only into a BLANK:
//
//   PARK WINS (#1004/#1008). A parked row is never delivered. An incoming
//     `deliveredDay` is dropped for any label this device holds parked — a file
//     must not be able to file a package the person deliberately deferred.
//   A `still-open` WINS for the same reason: it is the standing veto on the
//     absence sweep, and an import is an absence read on another machine.
//   A LOCAL deliveredDay IS NEVER CLEARED by an import. Merge removes nothing.
//
// OVERRIDES MERGE ADDITIVELY, EITHER DEVICE WINS, NEWEST DAY ON A CONFLICT.
// These are the two desks' answers about the same packages and both are real,
// so unlike an AREA there is nothing to arbitrate by refusing: a label this
// device has no answer for takes the incoming one. Where BOTH devices answered
// the same label differently, the MOST RECENT DAY wins — which is
// latest-write-wins, deliberately, and the opposite of the areas rule, because
// an override is a person changing their mind about one package rather than two
// people disagreeing about a belt. A dated record outranks an undated one; two
// undated ones leave the local record standing.
//
// AND NOTHING IN THE OVERRIDE STORE IS EVER SILENTLY DROPPED. There is exactly
// one incoming override this merge refuses, and it is COUNTED AND NAMED
// (`overridesSkipped` / `overridesSkippedLabels`) so the import summary can say
// it out loud:
//
//   AN INCOMING `still-open` STAMPED EARLIER THAN THIS DEVICE'S SORT DAY.
//   `still-open` is the only self-clearing kind: it speaks about ONE inference
//   drawn from ONE absence, and lib/tracking-overrides.js's clearReappeared
//   RETIRES it the moment a drop carries the package again. A retirement leaves
//   no trace to compare against — so the day the retirement can only have
//   happened on, this device's sort day, is the yardstick. An override stamped
//   BEFORE it is the one the local reappearance already answered, and re-adding
//   it would make that package permanently undeliverable on the pane and put it
//   on the Admin's list forever. Stamped the same day or later it is a fresh
//   statement and it lands, which is the ordinary two-desks-one-shift case.
//   `station` and `not-station` are NEVER day-judged: they are statements about
//   what the package IS, and they outlive every drop and every roll.
