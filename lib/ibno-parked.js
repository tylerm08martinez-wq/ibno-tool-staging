// IBNO Coder: Park and the Parked tab (issue #698, spec #690 user story 16,
// decision record #612 as amended by #613 rounds 19-20).
//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.IbnoParked
// - Node: require('./lib/ibno-parked')
//
// Park is the DEFER state for rows Tyler cannot answer yet, typically the
// no-address 999s he will look up in FTrack later. Parking moves the row out
// of the working list into the Parked tab in the Set aside group at the page
// bottom. It is the answer to what used to be a resolve-and-undo round trip
// to fake a park, and its rules are the ones #612 froze:
//
//   PARK WRITES NO RECORD. No archive entry, no resolution, no code, nothing
//   that reaches OPS2. The store below is the ONLY thing a park writes.
//
//   PARK NEVER KEEPS A PACKAGE ALIVE. Parked state has effect only while the
//   package is still present in the freshly loaded report. Handled on the
//   dock by someone else means it is simply not in the new report, and the
//   park is moot: the label is pruned, gone without residue, never
//   resurrected if the tracking number reappears.
//
//   PARK LIVES UNTIL THE PACKAGE DOES NOT. The store is a lib/sort-day.js DAY
//   STORE, stamped with the report's own INBOUND_DATE and never the device
//   clock (the 1:30 AM sort straddles midnight). But the stamp is a KEY, not
//   an expiry: a park survives a same-day re-drop, an F5, and a new sort day,
//   and leaves only by Tyler's own Unpark or by the prune above, when a fresh
//   report no longer carries the package (#730, 2026-08-19). It used to reset
//   on a new sort day, on both paths; see the four-line rule below.
//
//   PARK IS NOT PROGRESS. A parked row never satisfies scanned and never
//   counts on the progress bar as done. It writes no Goes To area, so the
//   worked/scanned readers never see it; the tool additionally drops parked
//   labels from the progress population itself, so the bar's total is the
//   list that still needs him.
//
// The store shape is the generic day store ({ day, items }). Each value is a
// PARK ENTRY, { source, day }, and nothing more (#753/#754):
//
//   source  WHICH REPORT the park was made from: 'main', 'post-sort', or
//           'unknown' when the tool could not name one (a migrated entry from
//           before this shape, or a park made with no report identity in
//           hand). It exists so a PARTIAL report may prune only the parks it
//           is entitled to speak about; see prunePostSortToReport.
//   day     the sort day the park was MADE on, so a park carried in from an
//           earlier sort day can be shown as carried rather than deleted
//           (#753). Per-label, unlike the store's own stamp, which follows the
//           clock forward on every load and therefore cannot answer this.
//
// It stays this thin on the same records-tier argument lib/barcode-done.js
// makes: a scratch deferral and a routing decision must not share a shape a
// records path could read. NEITHER FIELD IS A CODE, A DISPOSITION, A CATEGORY
// OR A RESOLUTION, and nothing that reaches OPS2 may ever be added here.
//
// The value used to be the boolean true. Those entries still exist on real
// devices and migrate through migrateEntries below, which must run BEFORE the
// store's stamp is rolled forward — read its own note for why.
//
// This module owns the RULES. The tool owns the DOM wiring, and nothing in
// here reads a global, a clock, or storage directly (the day-store mechanics
// delegate to lib/sort-day.js, the one home of "is this the same sort day").

  // ─── THE CARRIED ROW PROJECTION (#732) ────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // WHAT IT IS FOR. loadedItems above keeps the count honest whichever report
  // holds the main slot, but it can only draw a row some loaded list still
  // carries. Under ADR 0021 a Post Sort load runs a full resetApp() first, so
  // for the whole interlude the MAIN report's rows are gone from memory — and a
  // label parked off that pull, which the Post Sort slice does not happen to
  // carry, had no row in any list. The store was correct and survived an F5;
  // the badge still read 0, the chip and the group hid themselves, and the
  // package was uncounted and UN-UNPARKABLE until the main report came back.
  //
  // THE FIX IS NOT COEXISTENCE, and ADR 0021 rules that out explicitly. The two
  // reports still do not sit on the page together, the last one to arrive still
  // owns it, and nothing here makes a Post Sort load able to speak about a
  // main-pull park. What changes is only that a PARKED label keeps a minimal
  // projection of its row, so the tab can still draw it and offer its Unpark.
  //
  // TWO THINGS DELIBERATELY DIFFER FROM lib/post-sort-lane.js's snapshotEarly,
  // which is otherwise the precedent this follows field for field:
  //
  //   BOUNDED BY THE STORE, not by a report. Only labels that are parked right
  //     now are projected. That is what keeps the payload the size of the
  //     FTrack look-up-later pile (a handful of rows) rather than the size of a
  //     2,900-row pull — the localStorage quota trap that presents not as
  //     "storage full" but as "a refresh re-inputs the CSV". A wider population
  //     here is the same mistake in a new place.
  //   NOT SORT-DAY GATED. snapshotEarly refuses a superseded day because early
  //     rows are a mid-sort working set. A PARK IS NOT: since #730 it survives
  //     the day roll and leaves only by Tyler's Unpark or by a fresh MAIN report
  //     no longer carrying the package. Expiring the projection on a new sort
  //     day would make a carried park invisible again on exactly the day #753
  //     exists to surface it — the same bug one calendar step later.
  //
  // IT IS A RENDER AID AND NEVER EVIDENCE. Nothing in it may be read to decide
  // whether a park may be DELETED: "I can still draw a row for it" is not a
  // statement about where the package is. The two prune populations stay what
  // they are (pruneToReport for the main report, prunePostSortToReport for the
  // partial one), and the store remains the only thing that says what is parked.

  // cleared. i have to manually clear each one", and "i want if to fall off of
  // park if the fresh report drops it. so if someone on the dock actually
  // figures it out and get it to the right area then it should fall off."
  //
  //   NEVER clear on a sort-day roll.
  //   NEVER clear on a page refresh.
  //   NEVER clear on a re-drop that still carries the package.
  //   DO clear when the freshly loaded report no longer carries the package.
  //
  // The first three belong to followClock, which is why it has no reset branch
  // on EITHER path. The fourth is pruneToReport (and reconcileParked in the
  // tool). It is NOT "parks are never cleared": ripping the prune out to
  // satisfy a blanket reading of the first three would break #698's "gone
  // without residue" rule and leave parks on packages someone already got to
  // the right area.
  //
  // THE PRINCIPLE UNDERNEATH, which is what to reason from if a new case turns
  // up: a report's DATE is evidence about the report. Only a report's CONTENTS
  // are evidence about a package. Clearing a park is a claim about a package,
  // so it may be made from the contents and never from the date. Unparking is
  // real work Tyler does row by row, and anything that empties the set on his
  // behalf destroys it.
  //
  // ─── THE MIXED-DATE SHIFT (#698 review finding 1) ─────────────────────────
  //
  // Why the STAMP still needs care even though the items no longer move with
  // it. The 1:30 AM sort works YESTERDAY's main pull (dated Y) alongside
  // TODAY's Post Sort report (dated T > Y), and the monotonic clock moves Y to
  // T when the Post Sort report lands. The comparison in followClock is the one
  // lib/sort-day.js makes everywhere, isLaterSortDay: only a STRICTLY LATER day
  // re-stamps. Read against the store's own stamp that gives:
  //
  //   stamp earlier than the incoming day ... a later report: re-stamp
  //   stamp same as the incoming day ........ a same-day re-drop: unchanged
  //   stamp later than the incoming day ..... the SAME SHIFT: the clock
  //     reached the stamp through the Post Sort report, and this load is the
  //     earlier-dated main pull it ran alongside. Never roll the stamp
  //     backward (the clock is monotonic; the stamp follows it).
  //
  // Every one of those three keeps the items. The stamp is a key, not a verdict.

  // followClock(store, day) -> the store re-stamped for a freshly loaded
  // report, ITEMS ALWAYS INTACT. Both entry points below are this function:
  // neither the main-report path nor the Post Sort path may empty the parked
  // set, because NO REPORT'S DATE IS EVIDENCE ABOUT A PACKAGE. Only the
  // report's CONTENTS are, and reading the contents is pruneToReport's job.

  // It used to reset the whole set on a genuinely new sort day, on the reading
  // that the main report IS the sort day's own statement of itself. Tyler
  // removed that (2026-08-19, #730): a new date is a statement about the
  // REPORT, never about whether a package he set aside is still sitting there.
  // The wipe also ran BEFORE the prune and bypassed it, so it dropped parks
  // without ever asking whether the fresh report still carried those packages —
  // which is precisely the question that decides it.
  //
  // What replaces it is already wired and is strictly better informed: the
  // main-report path calls reconcileParked() -> pruneToReport() in
  // renderResults(), AFTER this runs, against the freshly loaded rows. So a
  // park whose package is gone from the new report still drops, by evidence
  // rather than by the calendar, and a park whose package is still on the
  // report survives the day boundary — still live work, still set aside.

  // carryAcrossRoll(store, day) -> the parked store for a POST SORT load. The
  // store follows the clock forward, items ALWAYS intact. It delegates to the
  // same followClock as syncMainReport since #730, structurally and not merely
  // by having the same shape, so the two cannot drift apart. It keeps its own
  // name because the two call sites are different acts and the tool reads
  // better saying which one it is.
  //
  // The four-line rule above governs this path too. The prune behind it is the
  // PROVENANCE-AWARE one, prunePostSortToReport (#754), never pruneToReport:
  // the Post Sort report is a partial population, so it may drop only the parks
  // it produced itself. A main-pull park and a park of unknown source leave on
  // this path only by Tyler's own Unpark, until a main report loads and prunes.
  //
  // Why this is worth having at all rather than waiting for the main report:
  // Post Sort is the daily driver (ADR 0021, and Tyler's own loop, 2026-08-19),
  // so most days no main report is loaded until the end of the sort, if ever.
  // Without it the fourth line of the rule never fires on a normal day, and a
  // park the dock already resolved sits stale through the whole shift.
  //
  // #730 asked for the opposite — reset the set when a Post Sort report from a
  // genuinely NEW day lands, matching the main-report path — and this function
  // briefly did that, gated on session provenance (an opts.shiftMainDay naming
  // the live main-report drop of the page session, since a mid-shift roll and a
  // new sort day are otherwise DATA-IDENTICAL here: both read as a stamp of Y
  // and an incoming report dated T > Y). That mechanism is gone. It could not
  // separate the two cases without also dropping parks across an F5, and every
  // wipe it performed was work Tyler had not asked to lose.
  //
  // The residual #730 concern is real and is answered the other way round: a
  // park carried in from an earlier sort day is made VISIBLE so he can see it
  // and unpark it himself, never deleted for him. That is carriedParkNote and
  // the per-label day stamp it reads (#753).
  //
  // WHAT STILL LEAVES THE SET, both untouched by this and neither one the tool
  // discarding live work:
  //   unpark(), the supervisor's own hand; and
  //   pruneToReport(), the fourth line of the rule above — the "gone without
  //     residue" prune (#698, #613 round 19), which drops a label the freshly
  //     loaded MAIN report no longer carries. Tyler's reason for it, in his own
  //     words: someone on the dock figured the package out and got it to the
  //     right area, so it should fall off. It keeps every label the loaded
  //     population does carry, so it can never delete a park that is still
  //     holding a row.
