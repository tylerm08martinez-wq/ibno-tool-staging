// IBNO Coder: the BARCODED state and the "✅ Work area assigned" tab (issue
// #734, spec #690, map #608). Rides the Set aside tab group built by #698.
//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.IbnoFiled
// - Node: require('./lib/ibno-filed')
//
// WHAT THIS STORE MEANS, and it is the one thing to get right here: a label in
// this store is CONFIRMED ASSIGNED — Tyler confirmed on the panel that he
// actually assigned it. That is ADR 0022's fourth lifecycle state, and it is
// stored INDEPENDENTLY of every other one:
//
// #993 WIDENED THIS AND THE OLD WORDING IS KEPT BELOW ON PURPOSE. Until #993
// this said "a card was generated for it AND Tyler confirmed", because the
// confirm panel had exactly one way in: "Barcode selected", which prints first.
// #993 added a second entry point, "Mark selected as done", for the normal case
// where the packages are already assigned to him and no sheet is ever printed.
// So a card is NO LONGER implied by membership in this store.
//
// WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, and is what every consumer actually depends on: the
// confirm panel is still the ONLY writer, and a row is here only because a human
// confirmed it. "Generation alone never files a row" still holds, now from both
// directions — generating does not file, and filing does not require generating.
//
// THE ONE CONSEQUENCE A CONSUMER MUST NOT ASSUME AWAY: markFiledBatch calls
// scheduleDeskPublish, so these rows cross to the other desk's Work area
// assigned pane (#971). An admin reading that pane can no longer conclude that a
// printed card exists for the row. Nothing in the code depended on that
// inference — it is a floor-procedure question, raised on #993 — but do not
// build a consumer that reintroduces it.
//
//   answered .. lib/actual-area.js. A row can be answered and not filed.
//   filed ..... THIS store (the state #734 called "barcoded"; #993 renamed the
//               MEANING, not the key — the localStorage key and every shape in
//               this file are untouched).
//   scanned ... lib/barcode-done.js. A row can be filed and NOT scanned.
//
// ADR 0022 INVARIANT 2, BARCODED NEVER IMPLIES SCANNED, is why this file exists
// at all rather than a flag on barcodeDoneStore. #697 made scanned deliberately
// per-row because Tyler scans every package individually ("i scan each package
// individually", #612 decision 3), so a dock-flexed sibling must not read as
// scanned. Filing is a BATCH act on one confirmation — a decluttering move, not
// a scan. Fold the two together and a filed batch of forty reads as forty
// scans, and the progress bar lies about work nobody did. Nothing in this
// module may ever read or write lib/barcode-done.js, and nothing in it may be
// handed to a scanned reader.
//
// GENERATION ALONE NEVER FILES A ROW. The writer is the confirm panel, never
// printBarcodesFor: a sheet can be reprinted or abandoned, and a silently
// hidden package is the failure the whole ticket exists to prevent. Unchecking
// a row on the panel, or dismissing it, writes nothing at all.
//
// SHAPE: a lib/sort-day.js DAY STORE ({ day, items }), the same shape the
// parked set and the resolved barcodes ride. Each value is a FILING ENTRY:
//
//   source  WHICH REPORT the filing was made from: 'main', 'post-sort', or
//           'unknown' when the tool could not name one. It exists for exactly
//           one reason, the same one #754 added it to the parked set for: a
//           PARTIAL report (Post Sort, which under ADR 0021 holds the main
//           slot) may prune only the filings IT is entitled to speak about.
//
// NO PER-LABEL DAY, and that is a decision rather than an omission. The parked
// set carries one (#753) because a park CARRIES ACROSS a sort-day roll and has
// to be shown as carried. Filed state does not carry: it resets on a new sort
// day (#734 acceptance criterion 7), so a filed entry is always from the day
// the store is stamped with and a per-label day could only ever repeat the
// stamp. A field that can hold only one value answers no question.
//
// THE LIFETIME, which is DELIBERATELY NOT THE PARKED SET'S:
//
//   survives a same-day re-drop and an F5 ....... yes, it is a day store
//   resets on a NEW sort day .................... YES, unlike Park (#730)
//   drops a label a fresh report no longer has .. yes, without residue
//
// Park is Tyler's own deferral with no other record anywhere, so #730 froze it
// against every automatic clear. Filing is a statement about a batch of paper
// that was printed and walked TODAY. Yesterday's assignment is not evidence
// about today's package (ADR 0022 invariant 6), and a tracking number does
// repeat across days, so carrying a filing forward would hide today's package
// behind yesterday's card. This store is therefore on the STRICTER rule, the
// same one lib/barcode-store.js's resolved barcodes ride.
//
// A FILED ROW IS NOT A FROZEN ROW, and the tool half of this ticket depends on
// it: Tyler still needs to code a 33 on a filed row, so the tab keeps the
// quick-code pills, the free code entry with Apply, the checkbox and the
// per-tab copy/barcode controls. Nothing here writes a code, a disposition or
// a resolution, and nothing that reaches OPS2 may ever be added to this store.
//
// This module owns the RULES. The tool owns the DOM wiring, and nothing here
// reads a global, a clock, or storage directly.
