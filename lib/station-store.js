// THE STATION DAY-STORE (#999, spec #996).
//
// #998 gave the Station tab a pane that reads the drop in front of Tyler and
// nothing else: a re-drop rebuilt it from the report, and the moment a package
// stopped appearing it simply vanished. That is the wrong shape for these rows.
// A station package is not IBNO work that resolves itself on the dock — it sits
// in the cage until the Cage A Admin walks it to the office and scans it
// delivered, which can be the next sort day or the one after. So the pane needs
// a MEMORY: what came in, what is still out, and how long it has been sitting.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE IS. A keyed store, modeled field for field on the Parked
// store (lib/ibno-parked.js) and riding the same { day, items } shape from
// lib/sort-day.js, holding the CARRIED ROW PROJECTION for every station package
// the tool has seen and not yet seen delivered:
//
//   label .......... the tracking number, the key
//   firm ........... the recipient cell
//   addr2 .......... where a vision-updated stray declares itself
//   status ......... STATUS_CODES1, as printed; what makes a row `coded`
//   inboundDate .... the report's own INBOUND_DATE, ISO
//   inboundDateRaw . the same column as printed, which is what the cell shows
//   firstSeenDay ... the sort day this tool first saw the package, which is the
//                    age fallback when the report carried no inbound date
//   deliveredDay ... the sort day it was inferred delivered, or absent
//
// HOW DELIVERED IS DECIDED, and it is DERIVED ON EVERY DROP rather than being a
// flag a human sets:
//
//   POST SORT DAYS have no delivered column at all. The Admin's 13/14/05
//   delivery scan is what takes a package OFF the report, so a station row that
//   was in the previous drop and is gone from this one is delivered today.
//   Absence is the whole signal, and it is the only one available.
//
//   THE FULL-DETAIL "Inbound and Van Scans" REPORT carries the scans, so a row
//   whose LATEST scan is 13, 14 or 05 reads delivered regardless of presence.
//   That is confirmation on the days that report is loaded, not a second rule.
//
// A REAPPEARING PACKAGE IS OPEN AGAIN. ingestDrop clears deliveredDay for any
// row the fresh drop carries, because the report saying "still here" outranks
// an inference drawn from it not saying so yesterday. That is also the hook
// #1002's `still-open` override rides: an override is the one thing that may
// beat the inference, and it is deliberately NOT in this module (it belongs to
// the general override store, spec #996) — `ingestDrop` takes an `isHeldOpen`
// predicate so the two can be composed without this store learning about kinds.
//
// ABSENCE ONLY EVER SPEAKS ABOUT THE POPULATION IT CAN SEE. `ingestDrop` with
// `{ absenceMeansDelivered: false }` adds and refreshes rows and applies the
// scan rule but marks nothing delivered — the answer for the main pull, which
// is a DIFFERENT population from the Post Sort slice (ADR 0021) and is not
// entitled to say a package the slice held is gone. And an EMPTY drop marks
// nothing delivered on either path: "the report parsed to nothing" and "every
// station package was delivered" are the same bytes, and only one of them may
// clear the pane.
//
// THE ROLL PRUNES DELIVERED AND KEEPS OPEN. That is the inverse of every other
// day store here and it is the point of the feature: an open station package is
// carried work that must survive the day boundary with its age visible, while a
// delivered one has already said everything it has to say (spec #996 story 23).
//
// NOTHING IN HERE IS A RECORD. No code, no disposition, no resolution, nothing
// that reaches OPS2 — the same fence lib/ibno-parked.js keeps, for the same
// reason. `status` is carried as the report PRINTED it and is never written.
//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.StationStore
// - Node:    require('./lib/station-store')
