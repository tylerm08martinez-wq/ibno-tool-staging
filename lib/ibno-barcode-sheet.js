// The barcode SHEET's own planning rules (issue #700, spec #690 stories 23/26).
//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.IbnoBarcodeSheet
// - Node: require('./lib/ibno-barcode-sheet')
//
// WHAT LIVES HERE and what does not. The sheet's *barcode* decisions — which
// half of an overlapping selection wins, and whether a card may be printed at
// all — belong to lib/post-sort-lane.js (the #693 extraction: dedupeLaneBarcode
// Entries, planBarcodePrint, barcodePrintDecision). Nothing in this module
// re-decides any of that; ibno-coder.html plans THROUGH post-sort-lane first
// and hands the surviving cards here for LAYOUT and for the area rule. Two
// modules deciding "may this barcode print" is exactly how a bare tracking
// number reaches paper (#667), so there is only ever one.
//
// This module answers three questions, all of them about the paper:
//
//   1. Is this address a real physical stop? (the invariant, below)
//   2. Which cards band together as one street, and where does each card sit
//      in its band? (round 23/24/25)
//   3. What may the card's big AREA line say? (round 27)
//
// ─── THE STOP-KEY PHYSICAL-ADDRESS INVARIANT ────────────────────────────────
//
// A stop is a NUMBER AND A NAME, or there is no stop.
//
// Found by Tyler on prototype round 24: zip-only and blank addresses were
// banding together as "same stop" on the sheet, because they compose down to
// identical junk strings ("85032", ""). A band is a claim that ONE FRO lookup
// covers every card in it — so banding two unrelated packages that merely share
// a ZIP is a claim to walk a package to the wrong belt.
//
// WHERE THE RULE ACTUALLY LIVES: lib/actual-area.js (isMatchable — leads with a
// house number and carries at least one more token). That module is what
// enforces it for dock-flex propagation; this one only composes it, so the
// sheet cannot drift from the thing propagation uses. Nothing here guards
// propagation, and no caller of this module should be relied on to.
//
// stopKey and hasPhysicalStop below are exported as the sheet's NAMED view of
// that shared rule — a seam the invariant's own unit test can address (spec
// #690 asks for exactly that test) and the granularity the sheet's bands are
// deliberately NOT using. They are one-liners on purpose; the value is that the
// two granularities are stated where the sheet's reader is looking:
//
//   stopKey(address)  unit-EXACT. "APT 171" and "APT 370" are different stops.
//                     This is the granularity dock flex propagates on (#612):
//                     an area typed on one apartment never spreads to another.
//
//   bandKey(address)  STREET-level, units stripped. "APT 171" and "APT 370" are
//                     ONE band. Tyler's Butler catch (round 24): 6767 W Butler
//                     Dr APT 171 and APT 370 are one FRO lookup and one walk,
//                     so the sheet must show them together even though dock
//                     flex will not spread between them. Visibility loose,
//                     spread exact.
//
// Both return '' for anything that is not a physical stop, and '' never bands.

  // The big line on a card is a COMMAND: whoever picks the package up walks it

  // there; everything else shows a dash and sends the package back to a human.
  //
  // Tyler's catch on round 27: cards were falling back to the report's own work
  // area, so a card read "999" in 30px type — which reads as "send it to 999",
  // a place no package goes.
  //
  // PRINTABLE PROVENANCE, and why each one qualifies:
  //   typed   Tyler typed it on this row. The case the feature exists for.
  //   auto    dock flex spread Tyler's typed area across the stop, unit-exact
  //           and guarded by the invariant above (lib/actual-area.js). It is
  //           the same decision he typed, applied to the same physical stop —
  //           dashing these would put a dash on every card of a band but one,
  //           which is the whole point of banding undone.
  //   early   Tyler typed it in the Post Sort pre-assignment lane (#634). Still
  //           his decision, just made against the earlier report, so it prints
  //           WITH the on-card UNCONFIRMED mark that #642 decided on. That mark
  //           is the card's honesty, not a dash.
  //
  // REFUSED, and why:
  //   report  IB_WORK_AREA and friends. The report's area is frequently the
  //           very thing that flagged the row for review.

  //   anything else, including a missing or unrecognised provenance — the rule
  //           is an allowlist on purpose, so a provenance nobody has thought
  //           about yet fails closed, to a dash.

  // ─── WHAT IS ACTUALLY ON THE PAPER (#704, chip-count honesty) ─────────────

  // Round 26 was "Multi-stop says 4, clicking it shows 2": a count computed
  // over one population while a DIFFERENT population is rendered. On the sheet
  // that class is worse than on a chip, because the number in the header is how
  // Tyler answers "did I lose a page?" — a header promising 6 over a 4-card
  // sheet sends him hunting for two packages that were never printed, or worse,
  // stops him hunting for two that were.
  //
  // The fix is structural rather than careful: BOTH the header count and the
  // done count are derived from `plan.groups` — the very structure the renderer
  // walks to emit cards — so they cannot be computed over anything else without
  // the renderer changing too. Nothing here re-reads the caller's request list.
  //
  // sheetLabels(plan) -> every label PLACED on the sheet, in print order.

  //
  // `done` de-duplicates by label while `cards` does not, deliberately: the tick

  // with the packages in hand, that all N of them are handled. The tool derives

  //
  // The sheet is a GENERATED DOCUMENT: document.write'n into an about:blank
  // pop-up on the main path, and set as an <iframe srcdoc> on the blocked-
  // pop-up fallback. It cannot `<script src>` this module — about:blank has no
  // base URL for a relative src to resolve against, and even where one could
  // be forced, a separately fetched script would race the inline handler that
  // needs it, on a document whose whole point is that it still works when the
  // network and the opener are gone.
  //
  // So before #873 the rule was RESTATED in ibno-coder.html's inline sheet
  // script, with a comment pointing here and NOTHING pinning the two together.
  // Measured on origin/main at 00897f1: inverting bandToggleTarget above left
  // tests/ibno-sheet-scan-mode-dom.test.js at 17 passed, 0 failed — an edit
  // here fixed nothing, the suite stayed green, and the paper a handler
  // carries to a belt kept the old rule. That is the csp-zip-breakdown.html
  // duplication without csp-zip-breakdown.html's drift-guard chain.
  //
  // The sheet therefore does not restate the rule; it CARRIES it.
  // bandRuleSource() serializes THESE VERY FUNCTION OBJECTS, and the sheet
  // builder splices the result into the sheet's own <script>. There is one
  // definition — this one — and the sheet's copy is a transport of it, minted
  // at print time. Change bandToggleTarget and the sheet changes with it.
  //
  // `str` travels too because bandDoneState calls it; a transport that dropped
  // a dependency would produce a sheet that throws on the first band click.
  // tests/ibno-sheet-band-rule-source-dom.test.js pins both halves: that the
  // emitted sheet carries this module's own source, and that a MUTATED rule
  // reaches the sheet's behaviour.
