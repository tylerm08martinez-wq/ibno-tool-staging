// and matches a query against any field.
//
// PRIVACY: this archive is localStorage-only. It is NEVER synced to GitHub and
// never written to the repo — recipient/address data stays on the device.
//
// Pure + storage-agnostic (the page persists/loads the array). Dual-loadable,
// no build step (mirrors lib/in-area-12.js): reuses IbnoRules for the single
// date normalizer + preamble detection so date logic lives in one place.

  // ─── ONE SCAN TIME, TWO REPORT DIALECTS (#855 review) ─────────────────────
  //
  // The two reports that reach this archive render IB_SCAN_TIME differently for
  // the SAME physical scan. Measured on the real 2026-08-13 pair:
  //
  //   Inbound and Van Scans  ->  "2:32 AM"
  //   Post Sort              ->  "8/13/2026 2:32"
  //
  // keyOf reads that field, so without a canonical form 2,700 of the Post Sort
  // export's 2,868 rows land under a second key for a scan the archive already
  // holds — Search Data lists the same package twice with two different-looking
  // times, and the Day Export's seen-rows inherit the duplication. This is what
  // made routing the Post Sort report into the archive (#855) unshippable in
  // its first form.
  //
  // THE CANONICAL FORM IS THE ONE THE MAIN REPORT ALREADY EMITS ("h:mm AM"),
  // AND THAT CHOICE IS ABOUT MIGRATION, NOT TASTE. Every entry already in a
  // device's archive was keyed off that dialect. Canonicalising to anything
  // else — 24-hour "02:32", say — would re-key all of them, so the next load
  // would re-add every row under a new key and double-list up to 30 days of
  // real history until it aged out. Normalising ONTO the incumbent re-keys
  // nothing that exists: main rows are already in this form, and Post Sort rows
  // have never been in the archive at all.
  //
  // A bare time with no meridiem is read as 24-HOUR, which is what the Post
  // Sort dialect's date-prefixed ".NET H:mm" shape means. Measured: no real
  // export carries an hour >= 13 (the sort runs 01:30 to about 10:00), so the
  // reading cannot be confirmed from the data either way; if a Post Sort export
  // ever shows "8/13/2026 14:32" this reading is right, and if one shows an
  // afternoon scan as "8/13/2026 2:32" it is wrong and this is where to fix it.
  // The cost if it is wrong is bounded: an afternoon scan would collide with a
  // 2:32 AM scan of the SAME package on the SAME day, merging two archive rows.

  // ─── SEEN ROWS FOR ONE SORT DAY (#855) ────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // The Day Export carries "the report rows the exporting device saw" (#795).
  // That used to be an in-memory accumulator in the page, which an F5 reset —
  // so a refreshed device exported only what it had loaded since. THIS archive
  // is already the persistent store of every row this device has loaded, keyed
  // by the same identity (keyOf) and pruned to the same 30-day window, so the
  // export reads it instead of keeping a second copy alive in a variable.
  //
  // SCOPED TO ONE DAY, and that is what makes the read usable rather than a
  // 30-day dump. It also settles the accumulator's other defect for free: a
  // page left open across the 1:30 AM sort-day roll used to fold yesterday's
  // rows into today's file. A day-scoped read cannot, by construction.
  //
  // The day is an ISO sort day ('2026-08-12') and is compared against the
  // record's OWN INBOUND_DATE, which is where the sort-day clock reads its
  // answer from too (lib/sort-day.js's sortDayOf). A record whose date will not
  // parse carries recordIso's never-prune sentinel and therefore matches no
  // real day: it stays in the archive and out of every export, which is the
  // safe direction for a row nothing can date.

    const d = String(day == null ? '' : day).trim();

  }

  // ─── THE ROWS WITH NO INBOUND DATE ARE THE POPULATION, NOT AN EDGE CASE ────
  //
  // recordIso stamps an unparseable INBOUND_DATE with NO_DATE so the prune
  // cannot drop it. Reading the export back by that same date INVERTED that
  // protection: on the real 21,584-record 2026-08-13 main pull, 1,733 rows —
  // 8.0% — carry ISSUE_TYPE "No Inbound Scan", COMPLIANCE_FLAG Non-Compliant,
  // and a BLANK INBOUND_DATE. A package with no inbound scan has no inbound
  // date by definition. That is the IBNO population; dropping it from the
  // handover is exactly the "structurally unable to find a package the Admin's
  // device saw" failure #855 forbids.
  //
  // SO AN UNDATEABLE ROW IS SCOPED BY WHEN THE DEVICE SAW IT, NOT BY ITS OWN
  // DATE. The store stamps it with the sort day of the load that brought it in
  // (seenDayOf below) and the export reads that. A dateable row is untouched —
  // it is still its own INBOUND_DATE, still on the existing `iso` index, so
  // nothing already in a device's archive has to move.
  //
  // The alternative — unioning the whole NO_DATE bucket into every export — was
  // rejected on measurement: that bucket is deliberately never pruned, so at
  // 1,733 rows a day it reaches roughly 52,000 rows and tens of megabytes
  // inside the 30-day window. Scoping by the seen day keeps one day's worth.

  // This settles it, for a whole load, and the order is the point.
  //
  //   hint     a caller that STATES the day the rows are of.
  //   rowsDay  the load's own majority INBOUND_DATE (SortDay.sortDayOf).
  //   fallback the page's current sort day.
  //
  // THE HINT WINS, AND THAT IS THE FIX #879 IS. The code used to consult the
  // rows first while its comment described the hint as being "for a caller that
  // knows better than the rows do" — a comment asserting an invariant the code
  // did not keep, which is the shape #740 is the receipt for.
  //
  // It resolves the hint's way rather than the code's because there is exactly
  // one hinting caller and it really does know better: the Day Export import,
  // whose envelope STATES the day it is of. An envelope is scoped to one sort
  // day by construction, so its rows with no INBOUND_DATE of their own — the
  // "No Inbound Scan" population this tool is named for — belong to that day
  // and to no other. The rows can disagree with it, and when they do the rows
  // are the ones that are wrong: a file taken by the pre-#855 build accumulated
  // across the 1:30 AM roll, so its majority date can be YESTERDAY while the
  // envelope is of today. Rows-first stamped that whole undateable population
  // with yesterday and dropped it out of today's handover.
  //
  // Nothing here reads a device clock. Every candidate is data — the caller's
  // stated day, the rows' own dates, or the sort day the loaded report set.
  //
  // A BLANK IS NOT AN ANSWER at any level: an envelope with no day (`env.day`
  // undefined) falls through to the rows exactly as before, so the reorder
  // changes nothing for a caller that passes no usable hint.
  //
  // AND NEITHER IS A MALFORMED ONE (#905 review). The hint now outranks the
  // rows, so it has to earn that: the Day Export file is deliberately
  // Notepad-readable and DayExport's dayText only TRIMS its `day`, so a
  // hand-edited '08/12/2026' would otherwise become the seenDay stamp on a
  // whole undateable population. That stamp then matches no day in
  // entrySeenOnDay / seenRowsForDay, and because a real "No Inbound Scan" row
  // has blank INBOUND_DATE *and* blank IB_SCAN_TIME its keyOf collides across
  // days, so mergeEntry overwrites the device's OWN correct stamp with the bad
  // one. That is the same rows-drop-out-of-the-handover failure #879 exists to
  // prevent, reached through a different door.
  //
  // So an unusable hint FALLS THROUGH to the rows exactly as a blank one does.
  // It is deliberately not coerced: '08/12/2026' is readable as a US date and
  // IbnoRules.toIsoDate would happily turn it into '2026-08-12', but inventing
  // a day from a payload we already know was hand-edited is the bug class here,
  // and the rows are a dated answer that came from the report itself.
  //
  // isIsoDay is TWO checks, and only the second one was ever load-bearing.
  // It used to run `rules().toIsoDate(s) !== s` between the regex and the
  // calendar check, on the reasoning that reusing the module's one date
  // normalizer beats writing a second near-identical day rule. It did not: the
  // anchored /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/ already guarantees the identity that line
  // tested, so it rejected nothing (#907 — proved by exhaustive probe and by
  // mutation, the suite stayed green with it deleted) while being the ONLY
  // thing that made this predicate need IbnoRules loaded. Dropped.
  //
  // The CALENDAR check stays and is the whole point: toIsoDate answers a
  // well-SHAPED date, not a real one — '2026-13-45' matches the ISO pattern and
  // comes straight back — and a stamp of a day that does not exist matches
  // nothing just as surely as a US-formatted one does. Date.UTC of numbers
  // already in hand reads no device clock.
  //
  // EVERY CANDIDATE IS GATED, NOT JUST THE HINT (#906). This used to gate the
  // hint only, on the reasoning that rowsDay and fallback are "computed from
  // loaded report data by SortDay, never typed by a human" and so have no
  // hand-edit door. On the one path that matters that is not true: the import
  // is `ingestArchiveRecords(result.rows, env.day)`, so the rows handed to
  // SortDay.sortDayOf are the IMPORTED ENVELOPE'S OWN ROWS out of the same
  // Notepad-readable file the hint came from — and sortDayOf's parseInboundDate
  // is shape-only exactly like toIsoDate, so one row edited to
  // INBOUND_DATE '2026-13-45' becomes the majority date and then the whole
  // load's seen-day stamp. It matches no day in entrySeenOnDay /
  // seenRowsForDay, and because a real "No Inbound Scan" row has blank
  // INBOUND_DATE *and* blank IB_SCAN_TIME its keyOf collides across days, so
  // mergeEntry overwrites the device's OWN correct stamp with it. Same failure
  // as the hint's, one level down. `fallback` is currentSortDay, set from that
  // same shape-only pipeline, so it is gated on the same reasoning.
  //
  // Falling through, never coercing, at every level: a candidate that is not a
  // real day is not an answer, and when nothing is a real day the result is ''
  // — which keeps an undateable row OUT of every export rather than into an
  // invented one. That is seenDayOf's rule and the safe direction.

  // Two reports reach this archive and they carry DIFFERENT COLUMNS for the same
  // physical scan: the main pull is 56 columns wide, the Post Sort export 35,
  // and the Post Sort set is not a subset. Once #855 normalised the scan time so
  // both dialects resolve to ONE key (see normalizeScanTime), a straight "new
  // wins" put stopped being a dedupe and became an overwrite: measured on the
  // real same-day 2026-08-13 pair, 2,695 of the Post Sort export's 2,868 rows
  // land on a main record and blanked 25 columns that held real values —
  // COMPLIANCE_FLAG, BELT, SCAN_BARCODE, IB_SCAN_DEVICE, PLA_LOOKUP, EDD,
  // FULL_SID, IB_TRAILER on all 2,695, plus DELV_COMMIT_DT, SERVICE_CODE, PSD,
  // PLANNED_SEQ and the two STATUS columns on most. 61,669 field values in one
  // load. That contradicts this module's own header contract ("EVERY row of
  // EVERY CSV … with all of its columns intact"), and it is the COMMON
  // direction: Post Sort is the ADR-0021 daily driver and typically loads last.
  //
  // SO A WRITE MERGES PER FIELD INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE RECORD.
  //
  // THE ONE DELIBERATE CHOICE HERE IS WHAT A BLANK MEANS, AND IT IS DECIDED ON
  // THE VALUE, NOT ON THE COLUMN LIST (#957, Tyler's call in #834 row 3).
  //
  //   a column the incoming report DOES NOT CARRY -> the stored value stands.
  //       The report said nothing about it. Post Sort has no BELT column at all;
  //       that is silence, not "no belt", and every one of the 25 losses above
  //       is of exactly this kind.
  //
  //   a column the incoming report CARRIES EMPTY -> the stored value ALSO
  //       stands. '', whitespace-only, null and undefined are all "no answer",
  //       not "the answer is nothing". A LATER REPORT'S BLANK NEVER CLEARS AN
  //       EARLIER NON-BLANK VALUE IN THE 30-DAY ARCHIVE.
  //
  //   a column the incoming report carries with a VALUE -> it overwrites. That
  //       is unchanged, and it is what keeps the archive current.
  //
  // `0` and `false` ARE VALUES and overwrite normally. They are answers a report
  // gave, not the absence of one, and this is a records store: coercing them to
  // "blank" would silently drop the only falsy data a report can ship.
  //
  // WHY THIS AND NOT "THE NEWER STATEMENT WINS" (which shipped in #878/PR #883
  // and is what this replaces). That rule read a shipped-but-empty column as a
  // statement, and on the real same-day 2026-08-13 pair it cleared 2,669 real
  // PRIORITY_PACKAGE values in one of the two normal load orders: both reports
  // carry that column, the main pull ships it EMPTY for a non-priority package
  // (21,533 of 21,584 rows), the Post Sort export ships a value on every row.
  // The two dialects were describing the SAME package — main's empty and Post
  // Sort's PLY — so the clearing was a dialect artefact, not a semantic change.
  // Both load orders are measured in tests/ibno-archive-merge.test.js:
  //
  //   Post Sort loaded onto a main pull -> 0 carried-but-empty overwrites under
  //       either rule. This direction never discriminated between them.
  //
  //   a main pull loaded onto a Post Sort load -> 2,669 under the old rule, 0
  //       under this one. That order is a normal day too — it is what #877's
  //       invariant 1 exercises.
  //
  // THE COST OF THIS RULE, STATED PLAINLY: a field that genuinely clears (a van
  // scan reversed, a status withdrawn) stays frozen at its last non-blank value
  // for the 30-day window. That is the accepted trade — this archive is a
  // 30-day record of what the reports SAID, and losing a value that was really
  // there is the worse failure of the two (records tier). If it ever needs
