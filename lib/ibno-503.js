// IBNO Coder: 503s, the bad-address flag (issue #699, spec #690 user stories
// 17 and 18, decision record #615, store shape #614).
//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.Ibno503
// - Node: require('./lib/ibno-503')
//
// 503 is a DUMMY ROUTE, not a real van work area. Tyler types 503 into Goes
// To, the package shows 503 at re-inbound, and the team stages it on a
// separate pallet and fixes the address when they have slack (#615: "my team
// should be the ones doing those since they have high visibility and they are
// there for them"). The flag IS the existing Goes To box with 503 in it —
// there is no new disposition control, and no OPS2 code, ever.
//
// TWO SEPARATE THINGS LIVE IN HERE, and keeping them apart is the point:
//
//   1. THE FLAG, which is not a store at all. A row is filed 503 exactly when
//      its Goes To area reads 503, so membership of the 503s tab is DERIVED
//      from lib/actual-area.js rather than duplicated into a second set. That
//      is deliberate: a second store could disagree with the box, and the box
//      is what the sorter reads at re-inbound. It also means 503 state gets
//      the sort-day lifetime, the same-day re-drop survival and the F5
//      restore of the area store for free (#690 story 22), with no second
//      thing to expire.
//
//   2. THE LOG, which IS a store: every 503 assignment, auto-recorded with
//      zero extra keystrokes, so the tool can answer "did anyone actually fix
//      this address" on a LATER sort day. It is device-local and NEVER
//      SYNCED — it carries street addresses, which are PII, and ADR 0016's
//      Decision item 2 is the wall: syncing address data would be the first
//      time it left the device, the most irreversible failure class. It fails
//      ADR 0018's durability test in the cheap direction anyway, since it is
//      re-derivable from the session archives. Pruned at 30 days, the same
//      window Repeat History and the dated notes use.
//
// ─── THE REAPPEARANCE MATCH KEY: BUILDING LEVEL, NOT UNIT-EXACT ────────────
//
// Settled by Tyler on issue #699, 2026-08-19. DO NOT RE-LITIGATE.
//
//   - Label matching cannot work here at all. 503s are logged by ADDRESS, but
//     rows are keyed by label (tracking number) everywhere in this codebase,
//     and a re-shipped package arrives with a NEW tracking number.
//   - The question the signal answers is "did anyone actually fix this
//     address". An address reappearing at a different unit is still an
//     unfixed address, so a unit-exact key would miss the common case.
//   - The costs are asymmetric. The signal is a quiet count, so a false
//     positive costs a glance while a false negative costs the entire point
//     of the flag.
//
// NOTE THE DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY WITH DOCK FLEX. The unit-exact rule elsewhere
// in this feature governs Goes To AREA PROPAGATION, where handing a sorter the
// wrong area is a records-tier error, so it uses IbnoWorkLoop's unit-exact
// stop key. Reappearance detection is a different concern with different
// stakes. The two rules are MEANT to diverge; unifying them would break one of
// them whichever way it went.
//
// The key itself is lib/address-normalize.js's stripUnitTokens, which already
// exists as the repo's building-level key (house number through the street
// suffix, everything after it dropped). No second key was invented for this.
//
// Confidence on record: moderate (~70%). What would revise it: if the
// station's 503s turn out to be mostly unit-level errors where the building
// itself is fine.

  // ─── THE TWO GROUPS THE 503s TAB SHOWS (#944) ─────────────────────────────
  //
  // Until #944 the tab was one list and "the Goes To reads 503" was the whole
  // membership rule, so the row LEFT the working lane on the keystroke. Tyler,
  // 2026-09-03, split that into two separate questions, and the split is the
  // point: what the tab shows is now the union of two populations that arrive
  // by completely different routes and must not be answered by one predicate
  // (ADR 0022's rule, stated for this feature).
  //
  //   HANDED OFF ...... Tyler typed (or one-clicked) 503 AND then barcoded the
  //                     row and confirmed it on the panel. Typing alone no
  //                     longer moves it: the row stays in the lane, visibly
  //                     tagged, selectable for "Barcode selected", and it
  //                     crosses into the tab at the barcode-confirm OK. The
  //                     second half of that AND is the BARCODED state, which
  //                     lives in lib/ibno-filed.js and is passed in here as a
  //                     predicate — this module still never reads a store.
  //
  //   ALREADY INBOUND . the package's own IB_WORK_AREA on the report reads
  //                     503, i.e. it was re-inbounded onto the bad-address
  //                     pallet before it ever reached this tool. Nobody typed
  //                     anything; there is no Goes To value to read. Tyler:
  //                     "we are the ones that assign all 503s, I only want to
  //                     work them in their section", so these are held OUT of
  //                     both working lanes and shown in their own group.
  //
  // THE GROUPS ARE EXCLUSIVE, inbound winning. A row already inbound to 503
  // that also picked up a typed 503 is still one package, and one package must
  // never be counted in two groups of one tab — the same rule decision 2 makes
  // about the 503s tab and the ✅ Work area assigned tab.
  //
  // AN INBOUND-503 ROW IS NOT A FILING. It writes NOTHING to the log below and
  // it feeds NOTHING to the reappearance signal (decision 3): the log answers
  // "did anyone fix this address after WE flagged it", and a package that
  // arrived on the pallet by its own inbound scan is not evidence about that
  // question in either direction. Counting it would light "not fixed" on
  // addresses this desk never flagged.

  //            different numbers: `day` must never advance (see record) or the
  //            reappearance signal resets itself on every re-filing, but
  //            pruning on a never-advancing day retires the entry 30 days after
  //            it was FIRST seen — so an address flagged on day 0 and again on
  //            day 25 went quiet on day 31, six days after the last filing, on
