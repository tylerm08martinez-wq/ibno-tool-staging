// Actual work area — the belt/area a package REALLY goes to, as decided by the

//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.ActualArea
// - Node: require('./lib/actual-area')
//
// WHY IT IS NOT THE REPORT'S WORK AREA: IB_WORK_AREA is what the package was
// scanned to — frequently the very thing that flagged it for review. The actual
// area is a human judgement laid on top. The two are shown side by side and

// ─── THE TWO ADDRESS KEYS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This module deliberately keeps two different notions of "same address", and
// the difference is the whole safety story:
//
//   exactKey   — unit-preserving. "APT 2" and "APT 5" are DIFFERENT. This is
//                what PROPAGATION uses, so typing an area on one package can
//                never put a different apartment's package on the wrong belt.
//
//   clusterKey — building-level, unit stripped. "APT 2" and "APT 5" are the
//                SAME. This is what SORTING uses, so every package for one
//                building sits together in the list and can be worked in one
//                pass.
//
// Both fold formatting: "1234 N Main St" and "1234 NORTH MAIN STREET" match
// under either key, because both run through lib/address-normalize.js — the
// same canonicalization the Address Catcher joins addresses with, so the two
// tools can never disagree about what one address is.

  // (issue #722). It means a human typed this area on this row. Before #722 the
  // same fact was inferred from the ABSENCE of both `auto` and `early`, and
  // that inference is what made ibno-coder.html's areaProvenanceOf end in a
  // `return 'typed'` catch-all: every value that reached this store, however it
  // got here, was labelled hand-typed and printed on a barcode card in 30px
  // type. IbnoBarcodeSheet.cardArea's allowlist could not fail closed against
  // anything, because nothing could ever fail it. Naming the good case is what
  // makes the bad case nameable.
  //
  // It follows `early`'s and `by`'s precedent: a further independent optional
  // field, never a widening of an existing one.
  //
  // IT HAS EXACTLY TWO WRITERS, AND THEY DO NOT MEAN THE SAME THING.
  //   set()               a human typed this area on this row. The keystroke.
  //   adoptLegacyTyped()  this entry was already in the store, carrying no
  //                       provenance, when the migration boundary ran. That is
  //                       evidence it PREDATES the marker, not evidence of a
  //                       keystroke — see that function for the trade.
  // Nothing else writes it: propagation writes `auto`, the Post Sort lane writes
  // `early`, reflow writes `auto`. A reader must not treat `typed` as proof a
  // person touched that row; it is proof the value is ACCOUNTED FOR, which is
  // the question the barcode card asks. A future writer that
  // puts a report-supplied, suggested or carried area into this store writes
  // none of them, and its entry therefore reads as an UNKNOWN provenance and
  // dashes, which is the whole point.
  //
  // MIGRATION IS THE SHARP EDGE, and it is adoptLegacyTyped() below rather than
  // a stamp in restore(). Every entry written before #722 carries no marker at
  // all, so a bare `''` default would dash a real supervisor's typed areas on
  // upgrade. See that function for the decision and its cost.
  //
  // The date is the day the area was entered, and exists only so prune() can
  // drop stale entries — it is never shown and never compared for correctness.
  //
  // `auto` is PROVENANCE: true means propagation wrote this value, false/absent
  // means a human typed it on this row. Without it "never overwrite" also
  // protects a value this feature wrote, so correcting a mistake leaves the
  // other package at that address on the old belt and printBarcodesFor puts two
  // different belts on two cards for one stop. An entry restored from an older
  // snapshot has no flag and is therefore treated as hand-typed: never sweep a
  // value we cannot prove this feature wrote.
  //
  // `early` is a THIRD provenance state (issue #634, decided with Tyler on
  // #622/#612): a value written by the Post Sort pre-assignment lane, ahead
  // of the slower full report. It pre-fills Goes To exactly like any other
  // value, but MUST NOT satisfy "scanned" — see isScanned() below. A boolean
  // `auto` cannot hold three states, so this is a second, independent optional
  // flag rather than widening `auto`; that keeps every pre-existing entry
  // (which never carries `early`) reading exactly as it always has — a
  // migration that runs by construction (this module's own read path) rather
  // than a separate pass that could be ordered after code that depends on it.
  // `early` and `auto` ARE both set together, on exactly one kind of entry: a
  // sibling that setEarly's propagation filled (2026-08-17). It is auto because
  // no one typed it on that row, and early because it is still unconfirmed, and
  // both facts are true at once. Every other writer sets at most one of them,
  // and restore() tolerates any combination from a hand-edited snapshot.
  //
  // `by` is ATTRIBUTION, not provenance (issue #793, PRD #790, ADR-0023 item
  // 5): the free-text name of the DEVICE that wrote this area. Under the 999
  // Desk an Admin works the Flagged Work Area rows on the cage PC while Tyler
  // works the same list from the other end, so "who typed this" stopped being
  // implicit the moment there were two of them, and a repeated wrong-belt
  // pattern is uncoachable when nobody can say whose it was.
  //
  // It follows `early`'s precedent exactly — a THIRD independent optional
  // field, added beside the other two rather than widening either. That is what
  // keeps every pre-existing entry (which carries no `by` at all) reading
  // exactly as it always has, migrating by construction through this read path.
  //
  // TWO RULES, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING:
  //
  //   OPTIONAL, ALWAYS. An absent `by` is legal and means "written before this
  //   device was named". An unnamed device answers rows exactly as it did
  //   before this field existed, and rows answered before naming stay valid and
  //   are never retro-stamped. Attribution is an improvement, never a gate.
  //
  //   INDEPENDENT OF `auto` AND `early` (ADR-0022). `by` answers WHO, the other
  //   two answer HOW, and no consumer may infer either from the other. Nothing
  //   in this module's overwrite safety reads `by`: a name neither protects a
  //   row from a correction nor exposes one to it. All eight combinations are
  //   legal and each survives this gate on its own terms.
  //
  // Unlike an area it is NOT upper-cased — it is a person's name, and folding
  // case would print MARISOL back at review. It is trimmed and length-capped,
  // because it is a name and not a notes field.

  // The cap is deliberately generous for a name and far short of a sentence.
  // The page's input carries the same maxlength so a typed name is never

  // Two rules make propagation safe to leave switched on:
  //   1. A HAND-TYPED value on another row is never overwritten — the human who
  //      typed it wins. Rows this feature auto-filled carry `auto` and ARE
  //      updated, so a correction reaches the packages the mistake reached.
  //      Typing on a row always claims it as hand-typed, so a supervisor can
  //      pin one package's area and later corrections leave it alone. An
  //      `early` value (issue #634 — a Post Sort pre-assignment guess) is NOT
  //      hand-typed and must lose here too: it was never confirmed against a
  //      scan on this report, so a human typing the real value on a sibling
  //      overwrites it exactly like an auto value would. Fixed 2026-08-12
  //      (/code-review on #642): the guard used to read `!e.auto`, which
  //      treated an early entry as if a human had typed it — the unconfirmed
  //      guess silently survived a human's correction on the sibling that
  //      should have overwritten it.
  //   2. CLEARING a row (area '') erases that row and the values propagation
  //      wrote FROM it, and nothing else. Those values only existed because of
  //      the row being erased; leaving them is how a stale belt reaches a
  //      printed card. A typed value at the same address still survives. An
  //      `early` sibling is deliberately NOT swept here: setEarly() never
  //      propagates (it only ever answers for the exact label it was fed), so
  //      an early sibling's value was never "caused by" this row in the first
  //      place — there is nothing for this rule to be sweeping away. The only
  //      way an early sibling becomes eligible for this sweep is by first
  //      being promoted to `auto` via rule 1 above, at which point the

  //
  //   opts.items  [{ label, address }] — the rows the page has just built from
  //               the report it has just loaded.
  //   opts.today  the LOADED REPORT's sort day (lib/sort-day.js), never the
  //               device clock. This module still reads no clock.
  //   opts.early  true when the loaded report is the POST SORT report, so every
  //               write is stamped `early: true` whatever the source says. See
  //               rule 4 below; the default (absent) INHERITS from the source,
  //               which is the main report's behaviour and is unchanged.
  //
  // WHY IT HAS TO EXIST: propagation fires when a value is typed, and spreads
  // only across the item list that existed at that moment. Tyler re-drops an
  // updated report several times a shift (#610, job 1), so packages for a stop
  // he already answered ARRIVE afterwards and land blank. He then re-answers a
  // stop he has already worked, which is the FRO lookup dock flex exists to
  // spend once.
  //
  // It only ever ADDS. It writes nothing onto a label that already carries an
  // area, removes nothing, and rolls nothing — the sort-day roll belongs to
  // SortDay.rollToSortDay and pruning to the loaded report belongs to the
  // page's reconcile paths. A function that only fills blanks cannot lose a
  // supervisor's typed work however it is called, and it is called on every
  // load.
  //
  // THE FIVE RULES IT KEEPS, each one an ADR 0022 invariant:
  //
  //   1. UNIT-EXACT (invariant 3). Matching rides exactKey, so APT 171 never
  //      answers for APT 328. Both keys still require a house number and a
  //      street name (invariant 4), so a bare ZIP matches nothing.
  //   2. SAME SORT DAY ONLY (invariant 6, #695/#702). A source entry must be
  //      stamped with the day being loaded. On a new sort day Tyler re-runs FRO,
  //      so yesterday's answer is a dated note and never a value. An entry with
  //      no usable stamp cannot prove it belongs to today and is not a source
  //      either — failing closed costs a convenience, failing open routes a
  //      package off a stale answer.
  //   3. NEVER OVERWRITE. Any label already carrying an area is skipped, typed
  //      or auto. This is deliberately stricter than set()'s rule 1, which does
  //      update its own `auto` values: set() knows a human just typed the
  //      correction it is spreading, and this function knows only that two
  //      answers exist for one stop. Choosing between them at load time, with
  //      nobody watching, is not a choice worth making silently.
  //   4. SAME PROVENANCE AS A TYPE-TIME SIBLING (invariants 1 and 5). Every
  //      write is `auto`, so the "same addr" tag shows and an area the
  //      supervisor never typed is never silent. `early` follows the LANE, and
  //      the rule is "whatever this lane's type-time propagation would have
  //      written":
  //
  //        opts.early absent (MAIN report) .... INHERITED from the source, which
  //          is what set()'s propagation does — an area typed on a main row
  //          spreads as a main value, one carried in early spreads as early.
  //        opts.early true (POST SORT report) . ALWAYS `early: true`, which is
  //          what setEarly()'s propagation does: it stamps `early: true`
  //          unconditionally, never inheriting.
  //
  //      THE ASYMMETRY IS NOT A WART, AND UNDOING IT SILENTLY BREAKS TYPING
  //      (#827). setEarly may only touch an entry that is absent or already
  //      `early` (its oursToTouch gate — the #642 hard requirement). A Post Sort
  //      load that inherited a MAIN-typed area onto its blank rows would leave
  //      them `{ auto: true }` with no `early`, and the supervisor's own blur on
  //      that very box would then be REFUSED, silently, by that gate. Stamping
  //      the lane's own provenance is what keeps the load-time re-apply and the
  //      type-time propagation writing the same shape, which is the whole
  //      premise of them sharing a pool.
  //
  //      `early` is also simply TRUE of these rows in its own terms: it means
  //      "not yet confirmed against a scan on the report this tool runs", and
  //      no row of the Post Sort report has been. isScanned() therefore still
  //      reads every one of them as unworked, so nothing here can make a
  //      package count as scanned, hide a row, or print on a card unworked.
  //   5. DETERMINISTIC when one stop has two answers. A hand-typed source beats
  //      one propagation wrote; ties break to the first occurrence in `items`,
  //      the report's own order. Without this the arriving row's area would
  //      depend on object key order.
  //   6. THE SOURCE MUST NAME A PROVENANCE (#722, added by #865's review).
  //      An entry carrying none is one nobody can account for, and this function
  //      is a PRINTING path in disguise: every copy it writes is stamped `auto`,
  //      which IbnoBarcodeSheet.cardArea prints. Without this gate the barcode
  //      card's guard holds on the injected row and fails on its siblings —
  //      card 1 a dash, card 2 the report's own 999, at the same stop, on the
  //      same sheet. That is ADR 0022 invariant 5 ("nothing propagated may ...
  //      print on a card unworked") and it is the ticket defeated one row over.
  //
  //      It is deliberately a gate on CANDIDACY, not a new tie-break. Rule 5's
  //      `held.auto && !e.auto` reads as "prefer a non-auto answer", and before
  //      this gate that phrase preferred an UNACCOUNTABLE entry over a real
  //      propagated one — the absence-inference this ticket removed, still
  //      deciding which area a stop gets. Removing such entries from the pool
  //      fixes that at the root and leaves rule 5's typed-vs-early semantics
  //      exactly as they were.
  //
  //      A legacy markerless entry is NOT lost to this: adoptLegacyTyped runs at
  //      the store load, before any report is dropped, so by the time reflow
  //      sees it it is `typed`.

    // decided it. Re-stamping on agreement would also quietly erase the one
    // signal that says a row came from the other desk, which is the whole point

    // desk: he types 200 over her 200, the entry keeps `remote` and her name,
    // she then clears her box, and applyTo's withdrawal pass deletes the row
    // HE PERSONALLY ANSWERED. Her clear is evidence about HER answer, and this
    // row stopped being only her answer the moment he typed it here.
    //
    // The two halves are separable and both are kept:
    //   `by` STAYS HERS — #909's decision, unchanged. `by` records who DECIDED
    //   this stop's belt, agreeing with a decision is not making it, and the
    //   #886 pill renders off otherBy (a `by` that is not this device), NOT off
    //   `remote`. So the pill still shows, the archive still says she decided
    //   it, and tests/ibno-by-tag-dom.test.js still passes unchanged.
    //   `remote` GOES — provenance, not authorship. It means "arrived from the
    //   other desk and was never answered here", and after his keystroke the

    //   withdrawal pass's reach (it tests `e.remote`).

    // Two consequences, both intended. The row now PUBLISHES from this device
    // (localAreas skips `remote`), which is correct — he has answered it, and
    // the other desk's setRemote will refuse to overwrite her own entry with
    // it. And it earns the barcode card's 30px line, which areaProvenanceOf
    // allowlists as typed/auto/early: that line is restricted to an area

  //
  // Applies an area the OTHER desk typed, arriving over the 999 Desk live loop
  // (#913). Writes { area, date, remote: true, by }.
  //
  // WHY A NEW FLAG RATHER THAN REUSING `early` (#887, decided at ~65% and
  // upheld in build). `early` means "pre-filled by the Post Sort lane, not yet
  // confirmed against a scan", and `.early-tag` renders straight off it. A
  // remote area did not come from that lane, so reusing the flag would put that
  // tag on rows it does not describe and make one surface answer two questions
  // — the #740 class. The two are also genuinely independent: the other desk's
  // area may itself have been typed early or not, and this device cannot tell.
  //
  // IT NEVER OVERWRITES A VALUE IT DID NOT ITSELF WRITE, mirroring setEarly's
  // hard requirement. A hand-typed value, an `auto` value, an `early` value and
  // a markerless legacy entry all win. The only entry it may touch is one that
  // is ALREADY remote (updating the other desk's own prior answer, e.g. when
  // they correct it) or one that does not exist yet. This is what makes #887
  // decision 2's "overwritable" true IN THE STORE and not merely on screen:
  // Tyler's keystroke goes through set(), which is unconditional on the typed
  // row, so his correction always wins and always re-stamps the author to him.
  //
  // IT DOES NOT PROPAGATE, and that is the difference from both set() and
  // setEarly(). Those spread a value across the same unit-exact stop because a
  // supervisor typing an address once should cover the stop he is looking at.
  // This answers only the exact label it was given: spreading someone else's
  // answer across packages they never saw is a second guess stacked on a first,
  // made on a device that cannot see what they were looking at. It therefore
  // takes no `items` list at all — there is no sibling walk to get wrong.
  //
  // NOTE WHAT FOLLOWS FROM NAMING NO OTHER PROVENANCE, both zero-diff and both
  // deliberate:
  //   - hasKnownProvenance() stays false, so reflow() will not use a remote
  //     entry as a propagation SOURCE. Same reasoning as the paragraph above,
  //     enforced at the one path that could route around it.
  //   - ibno-coder.html's areaProvenanceOf() allowlists typed/auto/early, so a
  //     remote area DASHES on a barcode card rather than printing. The card's
  //     30px line is a command a package handler walks a package by, and it
  //     stays restricted to an area decided on this device. Both are pinned by
  //     tests/actual-area-remote.test.js so they stay decisions rather than
  //     accidents of which flag happened to be checked.

  // classification still needed its say. ADR 0021 then gave the Post Sort
  // report the main slot, so EVERY box the supervisor types into on a normal
  // day writes through setEarly and is stamped early, and every row he answered
  // stayed "unanswered" to this loop. He pressed Enter through finished work.
  //
  // The #634 concern is still served, just not here: an early row whose area
  // the real report later contradicts surfaces by staying visible in the
  // working list and through the existing conflict signalling. It must not be
  // re-solved by parking the cursor on work he has already done.

  // THAT IS A COMPENSATING CONTROL, AND IT HAS A TEST (#785).

  // report swap: handleFile calls clearPostSortLane(), so the early lane and its
  // `.early-category-chip` / `.early-code-chip` are gone by the time this matters.
  // Before weakening isEarly(), goesToCell(), or that tag, read the test and
