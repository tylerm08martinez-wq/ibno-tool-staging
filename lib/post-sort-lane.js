// Builds the Post Sort "early" lane's row items from parsed Post Sort report
// records (lib/post-sort-scans.js), for issue #634 (third slice of #622).
//
// Dual-loadable with no build step:
// - Browser: window.PostSortLane
// - Node: require('./lib/post-sort-lane')
//
// WHAT THIS OWNS: turning one Post Sort record into the flat item shape
// ibno-coder.html's shared row helpers already expect — the same field names
// lib/ibno-rules.js's readFields() uses (label, address, postal, firm, ibWork,
// inboundDate, ibScanTime) — so this lane reuses zipOf/ispOf/streetOf/
// ActualArea directly instead of forking a second copy of that plumbing.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT OWN, DELIBERATELY: no QA Scan Code, category, or
// disposition. `PLA_LOOKUP` is genuinely absent from this report (see
// lib/post-sort-scans.js TRAP 2 and notes/report-registry.md's Post Sort
// row), so the classifier in lib/ibno-rules.js cannot tell a QA-Intercept, an
// Invalid HazMat, a Closure Portal, or a Hold to Match package from an
// ordinary one on this report. This module never calls IbnoRules.decideCode
// or lib/ibno-review-plan.js's rowPlan/offeredCode — offering a code on a
// guess is this repo's worst bug class (#602/#618). A caller gets rows and an
// address to pre-fill Goes To with; nothing here proposes a code.
//
// UPDATE (#649): this lane is no longer barcode-independent of the main
// report. IBNO Coder already loads Inbound and Van Scans, which carries
// SCAN_BARCODE — the exact string barcode-mode copy exists to reproduce, and
// measured to cover 96% of a real same-day Post Sort pull. buildMainReportBarcodeMap
// below reads that already-loaded report's FULL RAW ROW SET (ibno-coder.html's
// `lastRows` — every row the report parsed to, independent of whatever coding
// disposition lib/ibno-rules.js gave it) via lib/ibno-rules.js's own
// findHeaderIndex/columnGetter path, and applyBarcodeLookup's mainReportMap
// parameter lets it arbitrate over the Track IDs to Full Barcode lookup. This
// is still barcode resolution only — no code, category, or disposition
// crosses from the main report into this lane; the "no QA Scan Code"
// guarantee above is unchanged.

  //                    numbers for the lookup" batch) can tell a row that
  //                    needs no further lookup round-trip from one that does.
  //
  // Three-tier resolution (issue #649, follow-up to #635/#634 — read
  // notes/report-registry.md rows 13-14 and issue #649 for the measurements
  // this design rests on):
  //   1. SCAN_BARCODE from the already-loaded main report (mainReportMap)
  //      WINS OUTRIGHT. No lookup round-trip, no shape guessing
  //      (lib/barcode-lookup.js's trailing-tracking rule is not even
  //      consulted for a label mainReportMap answers).
  //   2. The Track IDs to Full Barcode lookup (lookupResult) covers only the
  //      fresh tail — rows mainReportMap has no answer for. This is exactly
  //      the pre-#649 behavior, unchanged for those rows.
  //   3. When both exist, SCAN_BARCODE arbitrates: mainReportMap is checked
  //      FIRST, before any lookup/conflict logic runs, so a label present in
  //      BOTH tiers always resolves to the main report's answer — silently
  //      correcting a wrong lookup candidate and resolving a lookup conflict
  //      for that label (a conflict with a SCAN_BARCODE present is answered,
  //      not a conflict — the #649 acceptance criterion).
  //
  // `mainReportMap` is optional (buildMainReportBarcodeMap's return shape, or
  // omit/pass {} to disable tier 1 entirely) — every existing caller and test
  // that calls applyBarcodeLookup(items, lookupResult) with two arguments
  // keeps its pre-#649 behavior unchanged, since an absent mainReportMap
  // never matches any label.
  //
  // For issue #635 (final slice of #622): closes the loop lib/post-sort-lane.js
  // opened in #634. `lookupResult` is the return value of
  // BarcodeLookup.parseBarcodeLookup(csvText, { requested }) — this module
  // does not parse the CSV itself, it only joins an already-parsed result onto
  // the lane's rows by tracking number (item.label === TRKID). `lookupResult`
  // may also be null/omitted (ibno-coder.html does this right after a Post
  // Sort report loads, and again whenever the main report changes) to apply
  // ONLY tier 1 — no lookup file has necessarily been dropped yet.
  //
  // GUARDRAIL (the reason this ticket exists): buildBarcodeMap already
  // excludes conflicting TRKIDs, so a conflicted label's `barcode` here is ''
  // — this function NEVER guesses between two disagreeing barcodes UNLESS a
  // main-report SCAN_BARCODE answers it (tier 3 above). A caller must treat
  // '' + barcodeConflict:true as "awaiting manual resolution", not "no data
  // yet" (see !hasBarcode && !isConflict below for that distinction). This
  // also means NO fallback to item.label (the tracking number) the way
  // lib/ibno-rules.js:225 falls back to trackingId for the current report —
  // that fallback exists so a barcode-mode copy is never empty, reasoning
  // that does NOT hold here: PKG_LABEL_XREF-shaped fallbacks on THIS report
  // are 9-11 chars and do not scan (see notes/report-registry.md). A caller
  // (ibno-coder.html's Copy-as toggle) must emit nothing for an unresolved
  // row in barcode mode, not the tracking number.
  //
  // MERGE, NOT REPLACE (Tyler feeds the lookup a TARGETED batch, not a
  // full-report join — notes/report-registry.md's "Track IDs to Full Barcode"
  // row): a label this lookupResult says nothing about (not requested, or
  // absent from the file) AND that mainReportMap does not answer either keeps
  // whatever barcode/barcodeConflict/barcodeSource a PRIOR call already
  // resolved for it. Calling this repeatedly across several small batches

  // SCAN_BARCODE is handed to the gated early half by dedupeLaneBarcodeEntries
  // above, and that half refuses. Its AC7 explicitly mandated leaving

  // click, no overlap needed, and the only reachable case under ADR 0021's one
  // report at a time — still printed a Code128 of the bare 12-digit tracking
  // number. #683 is that hole. The refusal is the same refusal, applied to the
  // same class of card, for the same reason: it does not scan, and it is
  // handed to a package handler as paper.
  //
  // THIS IS A CHANGE TO LONG-STANDING BEHAVIOUR, on purpose. Before it, every

  // NO LENGTH IS TESTED, exactly as #667 settled it: real SCAN_BARCODE values

  // overlap path it cost nothing, because the early half held the same value

  //      worked — 285 of 2,868 on the real mid-sort pull (measured 2026-08-13).
  //      This reads `items` (the whole lane) and applies needsWork itself
  //      rather than taking a pre-filtered list, so the caller's VIEW state
  //      cannot leak in: toggling the fold off to look at everything is a
  //      viewing action, and must not make a skip row eligible for a batch.
  //   2. Unresolved only, with the #649 division of labour intact: a row the
  //      main report already holds a SCAN_BARCODE for needs no lookup
  //      round-trip at all, and a row a PRIOR batch resolved must not be sent
  //      again.
  //   3. Not already answered-as-unanswerable (isBarcodeUnanswerable, issue
  //      #666 review finding 2). Without this the loop has no terminal state:
  //      a row the lookup cannot answer is re-sent forever and the lane never
  //      reaches "Nothing to copy".
  //
  // Drop either of the first two and the real pull puts thousands of lines on
  // the clipboard instead of ~168; drop the third and the loop never ends.
  //
  // STATELESS BY DESIGN: batchIndex is derived from how much of the lookup job
  // is already done, not from a counter. There is no session state to get out
  // of step with the data, and a re-drop of the same report reports the same
  // batch rather than inventing a "batch 4".

  // ─── EARLY-LANE CLASSIFICATION (#694, moved from ibno-coder.html) ─────────
  //
  // These four were inline in the page until #694 (pre-build extraction 4 of 4
  // on spec #690). They are the shared bucketing first-class Post Sort rows
  // ride, so they belong beside the lane they describe, where a Node test can
  // reach them. Behaviour is unchanged; the page keeps the state (postSortItems,
  // the fold flag, the lane cache) and calls these for the decisions.

  // earlyIsMine(item) -> THE one predicate deciding whether an early row is part
  // of Tyler's queue, shared by the stat cards (earlyWorkingItems) and by what
  // actually renders (earlyVisibleItems). One predicate, two readers, so a count
  // on a card can never disagree with the rows on screen (ADR 0021).
  //
  // Two conditions, the second added 2026-08-14 (Tyler, on the first real Post
  // Sort run through the one-at-a-time workflow: "its still showing all not just
  // my flagged work areas"):
  //   needsWork ............... the disposition fold (#657), unchanged.
  //   isWorkAreaFlagged ....... The Post Sort report is a building-wide pull;
  //                             on the 2026-08-12 export that is 289 rows
  //                             across 110 Work Areas, of which 8 sit in the
  //                             areas Tyler actually works. The other 281 are
  //                             someone else's queue and were burying his.
  //
  // FOLDED, NOT REMOVED — the same constraint the disposition fold obeys
  // (constraint 1 on map #608: nothing this tool does disappears). The hidden
  // rows stay one click away behind the SAME "Show all" toggle, which always
  // states its own count.
  //
  // Reads the SAME configured list as the Flagged Work Areas settings box and as
  // flaggedLookupBatch above, via IbnoRules.isWorkAreaFlagged — so what is on
  // screen and what the Copy button puts on the clipboard can never diverge.
  //
  // A MISSING IbnoRules IS FATAL HERE (#711, item 1 of the #710 review).
  //
  // The first extraction copied flaggedLookupBatch's quiet fallback: no rules
  // module meant "nothing is flagged", so this predicate answered false for
  // every row and the lane rendered empty, the stat card read 0 and the Copy
  // batch came out empty — three surfaces agreeing on a wrong answer, none of
  // them saying anything. The inline original in ibno-coder.html called
  // IbnoRules.isWorkAreaFlagged directly and threw, and earlyLaneOf below still
  // throws, so the quiet version was both a behaviour change and a second
  // answer to one question inside one module. It throws.
  //
  // Unreachable in the shipped page (ibno-coder.html loads lib/ibno-rules.js
  // and the deploy ASSETS list carries it), which is exactly why it must be
  // loud: the only way to reach it is a wiring mistake, and a wiring mistake
  // that renders "0 rows need work" looks identical to a finished sort.
  //
  // The check is deliberately BEFORE needsWork, so the fold cannot swallow it:
  // needsWork answers false for a skipped row without consulting IbnoRules, and
  // most of a real pull is skipped rows.
  //
  // flaggedLookupBatch above keeps its quiet [] on purpose and is unchanged —
  // it fails toward copying NOTHING to the clipboard, never toward copying
  // everything, and no count on screen rides it.

  // Tyler's decision, 2026-08-13).
  //
  // STALE-COMMENT CORRECTION (#711; out of scope for that issue, fixed here
  // because it is comment text in a file the change already touches): those
  // three keys WERE the MANUAL_LANES keys until #696 merged the page's lanes
  // into two need lanes, 'mine' and 'other'. The rule below is unchanged and
  // still unit-tested here, but ibno-coder.html no longer asks it -- the merged
  // page injects its own laneOf (IbnoMergedView.inWorkingPopulation) into
  // earlyLanesByKey, because a lane keyed on service is exactly what let an
  // express intercept sit under "not mine to work" (#616). Everything below is
  // the service split's own reasoning, not a description of what the page
  // renders today.
  //
  // It reads the `express` and `ibWork` fields buildPostSortLane above already
  // derives from EXPRESS_TRACK (the report's own service label -- "Express" --
  // NOT a tracking number, the exact trap #663 calls out) and IB_WORK_AREA, so
  // manualLane's rule 1 (isWorkAreaFlagged(row.ibWork)) does the work here: an
  // early Express row outside the flagged areas falls through to
  // 'express-other', which is precisely the intent.
  //
  // Its category-based rules 2 and 3 (Unassigned Zip, and the AREA_GROUPED
  // "worked alongside the flagged area" categories) used to be inert for an
  // early row by construction, because earlyReviewFields always set category ''
  // (#662). Since #664 they are LIVE: applyEarlyCode fills item.category from
  // the main report's OWN classification for a label it has already coded
  // 'manual' (and leaves it '' for the fresh tail the main report has never
  // seen). That is the RIGHT outcome under Option B rather than a leak of #664
  // into routing -- an early Express QA-Intercept now lands in the same lane its
  // full-report twin lands in a few minutes later, instead of jumping lanes the
  // moment the main report catches up. It changes nothing about CODING: routing
  // reads item.category, and #661's "explicitly not modified" list still keeps
  // decideCode/decideCodeInner untouched (applyEarlyCode never calls them).
  //
  // Why Option B and not "every early Express row into Tyler's queue": on a real
  // pull (2026-08-12 fixture) 72 of the 73 early Express rows are OUTSIDE the
  // flagged work areas. Routing them by the Express label alone would put 72
  // rows he does not work at the top of the lane that exists to show what he
  // DOES work -- exactly the mis-read the express-other lane was created on
  // 2026-08-06 to prevent. The Express split still holds for early rows; it
  // simply holds the same way it holds everywhere else in this tool, through
  // one shared rule rather than a second one that only early rows obey.
  //
  // A missing IbnoRules is FATAL here: there is no safe lane to guess, and a
  // silently mis-routed row is exactly the failure this extraction exists to
  // make untestable-by-accident. Since #711, earlyIsMine above answers the same

  //
  // The main report already survives a refresh (lib/ibno-session.js + the
  // page's SESSION_KEY). The Post Sort load had no save path at all. While it
  // lived in its own box that was survivable; now that its rows sit inside
  // Needs Manual Review, a refresh empties a group that looks like it should
  // persist, mid-sort, at the worst possible moment.
  //
  // PERSIST THE PARSED ROWS, NEVER THE RAW FILE. This is the known
  // localStorage-quota area of this tool. A Post Sort pull runs to thousands
  // of rows; storing its file text is how a ~5MB origin quota fills, and a
  // FULL quota does not announce itself as "storage full" — it announces
  // itself as "a refresh re-inputs the CSV", which reads as a completely
  // different bug and has already cost one debugging session here. So the
  // payload is a WHITELIST of parsed scalar fields:
  //
  //   * everything buildPostSortLane derives from the report,
  //   * the four barcode fields applyBarcodeLookup resolves — including
  //     barcodeSource, so #649's "main report SCAN_BARCODE always wins over a
  //     lookup value" arbitration still holds after a restore, and
  //     barcodeAsked, #666's terminal "asked and unanswerable" state, without
  //     which every such row is re-sent in every batch forever,
  //   * the disposition fold (#651) and the early-code decision (#664),
  //     plaArbitrated included — that flag is the ONLY thing telling a code
  //     the main report confirmed apart from one guessed off Work Area alone
  //     (the page's "no PLA" marker).
  //
  // Anything else an item carries — render bookkeeping like _ord, and any
  // field a future change hangs off an item — is dropped on the way in AND on
  // the way out. Restoring through the same whitelist means a hand-edited or
  // half-written payload cannot inject fields into the lane either.
  //
  // NOT persisted, deliberately: the fold state and the checked selection
  // (both already documented as per-load state in ibno-coder.html), and the
  // typed Goes To areas — those live in their own store (lib/actual-area.js)

  //   night. On a calendar-day stamp, a lane last rendered at 23:59 is refused
  //   AND DELETED at 00:05 — mid-sort, which is the precise moment #668 exists
  //   to protect. The inverse bites just as hard: a 1:30 AM sort worked on a
  //   report dated YESTERDAY would be resurrected later that same calendar day,
  //   putting last night's packages back into tonight's queue.
  //
  // The device clock is wrong in both directions because it changes in the
  // middle of one shift and is identical across two different sorts either side
  // of a midnight. The report is the only thing that knows which sort it is.
  //
  // Pure — items is never mutated. The day is derived, not passed in, so the
  // stamp and the rows can never disagree about which sort they belong to.

  // `sortDay` is the page's SORT-DAY CLOCK as it already stands (the page hands
  // in currentSortDay, '' on a cold boot). The gate is the same FORWARD-ONLY
  // rule applySortDayFrom uses and lib/sort-day.js documents as "reset on a new
  // sort day": a payload is refused only when the page ALREADY KNOWS a LATER
  // sort day. That is the one circumstance under which these rows are provably
  // last night's — and it is a fact about the sort, not about the calendar.
  //
  // Three refusals, each for its own reason:
  //   * unreadable rows ....... a lane whose own dates will not parse is an
  //                             unprovable working set; an empty lane the
  //                             supervisor fixes with one drop of the report he
  //                             already has is strictly better.
  //   * a stamp that disagrees with the rows ... the payload was hand-edited
  //                             or half-written. The stamp cannot be used to
  //                             smuggle rows past the clock, because it is
  //                             re-derived from the rows and compared.
  //   * a wrong version ....... this build does not know the shape.
